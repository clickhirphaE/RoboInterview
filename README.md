# RoboInterview


This application will prevent companies from having to conduct in-person interviews. 
This can save them time and money in the long-run and increase productivity.

Allows users to submit resumes for specific jobs on a website. Their submitted resume would be scanned for keywords related 
to the position they're applying for. If the applicant's resume contain 80% of the keywords listed for a job description, 
the robot would conduct an interview with the applicant.
The robot generates a series of questions ask the user during the interview, while a set number of behavioral 
questions are asked for all positions and a separate set of technical questions tailored to each job.

Prior to the interview, the user should be allowed to choose a date and time they're available for the interview, 
no more than two weeks out from the interview offer date.
